# AutoClicker_V2
This new autoclicker is made with C#, so no more CLI! It has a graphic interface for easier control over the clicker and also let's you save and load configuration files with different settings.

Some cool features I made that made my gaming seasons easier is **Near point click**. Enabling that, it will click around the mouse cursor based on a certain radius.
I hope you will find it usefull and easy to use :)
